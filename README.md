CommandCraft was a popular mod that unlocked the full potential of Minecraft Pocket Edition on Android and iOS by allowing players to control their worlds through commands. For example, `/time` would set the time of the day and `/give` would give the player a specified item. Most of the commands were mere replicas of the PC counterpart of the game. The mod also included extra commands like `/disguise`, which let players disguise into animals and monsters to troll their friends. The development of the mod was discontinued on August 2016, exactly 2 years after its inception, since Mojang / Microsoft finally implemented commands into the game and the modded client, BlockLauncher, never caught up with the latest versions of the game.

## Installation

BlockLauncher (formerly known as MCPELauncher) is an application made for Android devices which allows you to install Minecraft mods. CommandCraft depends on the APIs exposed by this launcher. The mod is no longer possible to run on the latest versions of the game. You'll need an old copy of Minecraft that is compatible with the latest version of BlockLauncher on Github.
